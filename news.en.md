### 21.02.2017
## Important note for Amazon Echo
<b>Please do not use the native iOS app of Amazon Alexa to install Conrad Connect skill, 
as this method is not yet supported. </b>
The best way to perform the installation is to do it via Amazon Alexa web app.
<br>1. Open the following link in a browser and log in to your Amazon Alexa account:  http://alexa.amazon.de
<br>2. Go to the "Skills" menu and search for "Conrad Connect".
<br>3. Press "Enable" button and provide the credentials to your Conrad Connect account. 

Note:
<br>Amazon Alexa allows you to start Do Recipes with your voice. The service cannot be used directly in the graphical rule (Recipe) editor as sensor or actuator.

To have a Do Recipe executed by Alexa (e.g. a Do Recipe named "Light"), just say "Alexa, connect to Conrad Connect", then "Please, execute Light". You can also say "Alexa, please tell Conrad Connect to start Light".
